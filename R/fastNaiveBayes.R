#' @description  This is an extremely fast implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier. This package is
#' currently the only package that supports a Bernoulli distribution, a Multinomial distribution,
#' and a Gaussian distribution, making it suitable for both binary features, frequency counts,
#' and numerical features. Another feature is the support of a mix of different event models.
#' Only numerical variables are allowed, however, categorical variables can be transformed into
#' dummies and used with the Bernoulli distribution.
#'
#' This implementation offers a huge performance gain compared to other implementations in R.
#' The execution times were compared on a data set of tweets and this package was found to be
#' around 283 to 34,841 times faster for the Bernoulli event models and 17 to 60 times faster
#' for the Multinomial model. For the Gaussian distribution this package was found to be
#' between 2.8 and 1679 times faster. See the vignette for more details.
#'
#' The implementation is largely based on the paper
#' "A comparison of event models for Naive Bayes anti-spam e-mail filtering" written by
#' K.M. Schneider (2003) <doi:10.3115/1067807>.
#'
#' Any issues can be submitted to: <https://github.com/mskogholt/fastNaiveBayes/issues>.
#'
#' For a complete list of functions, use library(help = "fastNaiveBayes").
#'
#' The easiest starting point is to use the fnb.train function. This will convert the data to a suitable format
#' and determine the distributions to use for each feature.

#' @title Fast Naive Bayes Classifier for different Distributions
#' @description Extremely fast implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier.
#'
#' @param x a numeric matrix, or a dgcMatrix
#' @param y a factor of classes
#' @param laplace A number used for Laplace smoothing. Default is 0
#' @param sparse Use a sparse matrix? If true a sparse matrix will be constructed from x.
#'     It's possible to directly feed a sparse dgcMatrix as x, which will set this parameter to TRUE
#' @param distribution A list with distribution names and column names for which to use the distribution, see examples.
#' @param ... Not used.
#'
#' @details A Naive Bayes classifier that assumes independence between the feature variables. Currently, either a Bernoulli,
#'     multinomial, or Gaussian distribution can be used. The bernoulli distribution should be used when the features are 0 or 1 to
#'     indicate the presence or absence of the feature in each document. The multinomial distribution should be used when the
#'     features are the frequency that the feature occurs in each document. Finally, the Gaussian distribution
#'     should be used with numerical variables. fnb.mixed uses the distribution parameter to mix different distributions
#'     for different columns in the input matrix
#'
#'     By setting sparse = TRUE the numeric matrix x will be converted to a sparse dgcMatrix. This can be considerably faster
#'     in case few observations have a value different than 0.
#'
#'     It's also possible to directly supply a sparse dgcMatrix, which can be a lot faster in case a fastNaiveBayes model
#'     is trained multiple times on the same matrix or a subset of this. See examples for more details. Bear in mind that
#'     converting to a sparse matrix can actually be slower depending on the data.
