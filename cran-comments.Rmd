## comments
### New Features
- threshold in all predict functions to ensure a minimum probability
- Added tweets and tweetsDTM datasets as example data and for time comparisons
- Changed Gaussian model to achieve a huge speed-up
- Removed inefficiencies for both the Bernoulli and Multinomial models. Much faster now.

### Other Changes
- Removed std_threshold in Gaussian model, not necessary since the introduction of the above threshold feature
- Changed comparison to other packages in vignette
