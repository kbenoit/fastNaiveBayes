## Previous comments
Thanks, please do not capitalize words like "Classifier" in your 
Description text.

Please add more details about your package in the Description text.

If there are references describing the methods/algorithms in your 
package, please add these in the Description field of your DESCRIPTION 
file in the form
authors (year) <doi:...>
authors (year) <arXiv:...>
authors (year, ISBN:...)
with no space after 'doi:', 'arXiv:' and angle brackets for auto-linking.

Should all be fixed now. 

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs

There was 1 NOTE:
  Malformed Description field: should contain one or more complete sentences.

I really do not understand where this is coming from. Online I could not find any solution and the description text is clearly one or more complete sentences.
